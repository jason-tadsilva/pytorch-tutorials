        "In the [60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html),\nwe had the opportunity to learn about PyTorch at a high level and train a small neural network to classify images.\nIn this tutorial, we are going to expand this to describe how to convert a model defined in PyTorch into the\nONNX format using TorchDynamo and the ``torch.onnx.dynamo_export`` ONNX exporter.\n\nWhile PyTorch is great for iterating on the development of models, the model can be deployed to production\nusing different formats, including [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) (Open Neural Network Exchange)!\n\nONNX is a flexible open standard format for representing machine learning models which standardized representations\nof machine learning allow them to be executed across a gamut of hardware platforms and runtime environments\nfrom large-scale cloud-based supercomputers to resource-constrained edge devices, such as your web browser and phone.\n\nIn this tutorial, we\u2019ll learn how to:\n\n1. Install the required dependencies.\n2. Author a simple image classifier model.\n3. Export the model to ONNX format.\n4. Save the ONNX model in a file.\n5. Visualize the ONNX model graph using [Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron).\n6. Execute the ONNX model with `ONNX Runtime`\n7. Compare the PyTorch results with the ones from the ONNX Runtime.\n\n## 1. Install the required dependencies\nBecause the ONNX exporter uses ``onnx`` and ``onnxscript`` to translate PyTorch operators into ONNX operators,\nwe will need to install them.\n\n```bash\npip install onnx\npip install onnxscript\n```\n## 2. Author a simple image classifier model\n\nOnce your environment is set up, let\u2019s start modeling our image classifier with PyTorch,\nexactly like we did in the [60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html).\n\n\n"

Execute the ONNX model with ONNX Runtime\n\nThe last step is executing the ONNX model with `ONNX Runtime`, but before we do that, let's install ONNX Runtime.\n\n```bash\npip install onnxruntime\n```\nThe ONNX standard does not support all the data structure and types that PyTorch does,\nso we need to adapt PyTorch input's to ONNX format before feeding it to ONNX Runtime.\nIn our example, the input happens to be the same, but it might have more inputs\nthan the original PyTorch model in more complex models.\n\nONNX Runtime requires an additional step that involves converting all PyTorch tensors to Numpy (in CPU)\nand wrap them on a dictionary with keys being a string with the input name as key and the numpy tensor as the value.\n\nNow we can create an *ONNX Runtime Inference Session*, execute the ONNX model with the processed input\nand get the output. In this tutorial, ONNX Runtime is executed on CPU, but it could be executed on GPU as well.\n\n"
