        "\n# Multi-Objective NAS with Ax\n\n**Authors:** [David Eriksson](https://github.com/dme65)_,\n[Max Balandat](https://github.com/Balandat)_,\nand the Adaptive Experimentation team at Meta.\n\nIn this tutorial, we show how to use [Ax](https://ax.dev/)_ to run\nmulti-objective neural architecture search (NAS) for a simple neural\nnetwork model on the popular MNIST dataset. While the underlying\nmethodology would typically be used for more complicated models and\nlarger datasets, we opt for a tutorial that is easily runnable\nend-to-end on a laptop in less than 20 minutes.\n\nIn many NAS applications, there is a natural tradeoff between multiple\nobjectives of interest. For instance, when deploying models on-device\nwe may want to maximize model performance (for example, accuracy), while\nsimultaneously minimizing competing metrics like power consumption,\ninference latency, or model size in order to satisfy deployment\nconstraints. Often, we may be able to reduce computational requirements\nor latency of predictions substantially by accepting minimally lower\nmodel performance. Principled methods for exploring such tradeoffs\nefficiently are key enablers of scalable and sustainable AI, and have\nmany successful applications at Meta - see for instance our\n[case study](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2021/07/optimizing-model-accuracy-and-latency-using-bayesian-multi-objective-neural-architecture-search/)_\non a Natural Language Understanding model.\n\nIn our example here, we will tune the widths of two hidden layers,\nthe learning rate, the dropout probability, the batch size, and the\nnumber of training epochs. The goal is to trade off performance\n(accuracy on the validation set) and model size (the number of\nmodel parameters).\n\nThis tutorial makes use of the following PyTorch libraries:\n\n- [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning)_ (specifying the model and training loop)\n- [TorchX](https://github.com/pytorch/torchx)_ (for running training jobs remotely / asynchronously)\n- [BoTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/botorch)_ (the Bayesian Optimization library powering Ax's algorithms)\n"
