PyTorch: Tensors and autograd
-------------------------------

A third order polynomial, trained to predict :math:`y=\sin(x)` from :math:`-\pi`
to :math:`\pi` by minimizing squared Euclidean distance.

This implementation computes the forward pass using operations on PyTorch
Tensors, and uses PyTorch autograd to compute gradients.


A PyTorch Tensor represents a node in a computational graph. If ``x`` is a
Tensor that has ``x.requires_grad=True`` then ``x.grad`` is another Tensor
holding the gradient of ``x`` with respect to some scalar value.
